Bash scripting basics for my students in ITEC 3860/3870 (Software Development 1/2)

<strike>You can easily try bash by creating an account at http://c9.io (Cloud9 IDE)</strike>

You can easily try bash for 5 bucks a month at https://m.do.co/c/7073ae5974da (DigitalOcean) 

You can try DigitalOcean for free (usually for about 60 days) if you provide your credit card number but you will need to prepay 5 bucks if you want to use PayPal.
